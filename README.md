<h1><name>Elaine Dunlap<name></h1> 
<h2>I design products and experiences. I like to ask a lot of questions and make with my hands.</h2>
<p>I'm interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>usability</li>
<li>screen typography</li>
<li>html5 / css3</li>
<li>responsive design patterns</li>
<li>close collab with stakeholders and developers</li>
<li>agile ux</li>
 </ul>

<p>I have a BFA in Illustration from RISD. Now and then I'll draw, paint, weave fabric by hand, and arrange flowers. </p>

<p>Most recently I was a Site Designer at SAY Media. I designed this responsive image gallery for Remodelista.com. </p>

<h3>I'm looking for a full time role with an awesome team in New York City. Are you hiring?</h3>
